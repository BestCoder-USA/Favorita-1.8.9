## How do I use it?
### The mod adds a new keybinding called "Favorite Slot" which is set to F by default.
### When you press it while hovering over an item in your inventory, it will mark that slot as a favorite.
### Or, if you're not in an inventory screen, it will mark the hotbar slot you currently have selected as favorited.

## What does the mod block?
## If the (hotbar) slot is favorited, you can't:

### Move the item within it
- Drop the item
- Wipe that slot using the bin slot
- Quick move items into or out of that slot
- Swap an item into or out of that slot
- Where will the mod block these actions?
- In the player inventory
- In the hotbar in any container
- In your offhand slot
- In your armor slots
